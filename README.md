# API Management Secrets
Common terminology and processes in the life of a web service (API) consumer, manager and provider. everything explained in plain english. 


Navigating through a website is an activity done by humans. Hence the website should be human friendly. 
A website is promoted by search engines. Therefore the website should be SEO friendly.
The website's business is managed by a bunch of CXO's that are asking for improved metrics results day after day, therefore the website should be marketing friendly. 

An API and a website is built and shared almost the same way. But everything that is made for human consumption should be fancy, with glitters and well chosen colors, with quality copy content, shiny imagery, an organized structure and a lot of buttons, drop-downs, text boxes to be used for interactivity. Therefore the website, along with the expected information, should also load a lot of CSS sheets (for styling), Javascript (for interactivity), HTML files (for structure). 

Machines are awesome, they just don't care about colors and shapes. They only need the strict info that was requested. No styling, no bling, no risk. APIs are just that, a server that is returning the strictly needed content. In plain text, json, xml, binary file or a combination of the previous.
